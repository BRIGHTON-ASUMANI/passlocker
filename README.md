### __Problem Solving__
> People do have multiple accounts and their passwords some of this accounts include:
> 1. facebook
> 2. Twitter
> 3. Gmail
> 4. Slack etc.
> The problem that arises is that people tend to forget some passwords of different accounts
> ...Therefore this application solves this problem by storing a user's account and the password related to it.
> An example is like twitter. You can store the \*account\*: *twitter* and the \*password\*: *twitterpassword*

### __How the application works__
1. First of all the user has to be able to run the application using \*_python3.6 functionality.py_\* but if the user has run the following command \*chmod +x functionality.py\* on the terminal he can run the application by typing *./functionality.py*

2. When the user runs the application The user gets to create an account. There are three keywords that are in the instructions the user has to input
  > **_create:_** this for creating the account. After this the user will be prompted to log in
      * *note*. You can either decide to genearate your own password or use the default password :
              > *d:* genarates a default password for you
              > *p* genarates your own password
  > **_login:_** this will prompt the user to a login menu where he/she will create an account after they have registered
  > **_exit:_** this will exit the Application

3. Once a user is logged a menu will pop-up requesting the user to enter the following codes:
  > **_c:_** creates an account and the password for the account
      * *note*. If you create an account you will be prompted to to enter a secret_key:
            > *sk* generate your secret key
            > *dsk* get a default secret key
            > ***_note: always remeber your secret key since it will be used to search for your saved account credential_***
  > **_s:_** search for your account credential
      * *note* you will be asked to enter the secret key of your account so as to be able to search for your saved account credentials
  > **_d:_** displays your saved credentials account and its password
